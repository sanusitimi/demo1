        <p class="fun">Welcome to the official page of the Sunshine Volunteers!<br>
        At our program, we value the health and wellbeing of youth through volunteering.<br>
        We encourage anyone who is 13 or older to join us in serving the city of Moncton<br>
        by picking up volunteering roles at various organizations. We believe this helps<br>
        to boost the health of those helping and those being helped through the kindness<br>
        and love we raise our volunteers to show. We also build a trust like family with<br>
        all the people we work with. We stand for love, kindness, peace, and helping out<br>
        even where help was not asked for as long as its needed.<br><br>
        We are a non-government organization and we accept donations.<br>
