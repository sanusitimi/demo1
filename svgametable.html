                    This can give you energy for the next day.
                    That enery will help you to get reasonable things done.</td>

                <td>Waking up starts the day.
                    When you wake up, you can eat, learn, and play.
                    This helps you grow and enjoy life.
                    It gives you chances to do new things.</td>

                <td>Dancing is fun.
                    When you dance, you move your body and feel happy.
                    This makes your heart healthy and keeps you active.
                    It also helps you share joy with others.</td>

        At Sunshine Volunteers, we care about health, happiness, and growth for everyone involved.<br>
        Just like John, who wakes up ready to learn and do new things, our volunteers are given chances to explore, grow, and make a difference every day.<br>
        We also believe, like John dancing with friends, that fun and joy are just as important as hard work — so we create moments where people can connect, laugh, and share happiness together.<br>
        And just like John getting his rest through healthy sleep, we value balance and energy, making sure our volunteers feel supported and recharged so they can keep helping others.<br>
        At Sunshine Volunteers, we know that caring for yourself and caring for others go hand in hand, and that’s what makes our community shine.<br>
